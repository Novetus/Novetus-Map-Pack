Built with my own hands really. I plan to add more and make it silly. Maybe more eventful and expand it into an actual neighborhood! 

I opened it back up for people to see, it'll be under construction for a bit. I'd love to hear some feedback once in a while if you guys would like to see this made into something more! 

Thanks c:
