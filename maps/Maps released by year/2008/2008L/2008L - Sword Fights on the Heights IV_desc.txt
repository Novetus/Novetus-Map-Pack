UPDATE: Windforce infinite fly bug fixed. Post comments/bugs/suggestions in the Creations forum. Lots of new stuff! Ghostwalker - a sword that makes you fall like a feather and becomes more powerful with each noob you pwn! Windforce - a sword that executes a devastating wind attack, causing your enemies to go flying! The Touchstone, at item which will teleport your character to The Locus. The Locus is a safe zone that links together different parts of the map through the Gateways. One Gateway leads to the Eyrie - where the Windforce lies. There's also a fiendish trap you can spring on unsuspecting fools! As always, this map is not copy locked. Feel free to borrow or dissect models or scripts from this place!
