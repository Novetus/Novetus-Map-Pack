This tower serves as the main command center for the ROBLOXian military. Once thought to be guarded as much as the Crossroads, it was later exposed to the public that it was unprotected. Its only inhabitants are the people trying to find a cause for the Killbots Invasion. Your job is to be their protection. Unfortunately, the Killbots have come in larger numbers than the Crossroads invasion.
