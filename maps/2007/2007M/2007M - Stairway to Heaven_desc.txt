Come visit a magnificent and picturesque town complete with a church, wonderful little house, and a luxury condominium! Climb the Stairway to Heaven to look at the world in a different way! Literally! If you are bored, either take a short walk in the park, or just blow everything up (look for the bazooka)! Have fun! Oh, one more thing, you might notice a lot of lag in my place, primarily because although the place is small, the number of bricks is probably over double the number of bricks in some of the multiplayer maps. Let the game load a while even after the initial loading is complete.
