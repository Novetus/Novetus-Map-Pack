For thousands of years, ROBLOXians fought to the death on this legendary floating structure. Known for it's unique and powerful swords, the Killbots have invaded en masse in an attempt to use the swords' power for their own gain. You were sent there to protect the swords and the sacred Locus, but it was too late. The Killbots have already damaged the Locus, disabling any invulnrability for ROBLOXians. Only the swords are left...

Note: 2007E won't be able to view the swords on this map because the client does not support Part Colors on SpecialMeshes.
