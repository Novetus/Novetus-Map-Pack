Can you find all the powerups? Players should now drop their weapons if they are bloxxed.

Update: I consider this level done, so I'm open-sourcing it. Feel free to copy, edit, change anything you like. There are many powerups hidden in this map for you to find. The Shield Sphere lets you make yourself invincible for 5 seconds. The Medkit lets you heal yourself once. The Jetboots let you fly. The armor gives you 3x health. The Firebrand is a big sword you can lay the smack down with. The Ice Dagger of Instadeath kills anything it touches and is the weapon of choice for bringing down fools with fifty medkits.
