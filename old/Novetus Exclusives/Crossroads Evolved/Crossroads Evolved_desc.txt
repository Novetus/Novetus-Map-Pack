Works well and tested with 2009L+. May not work properly in 2012M or higher.

One month after the Killbot Wars (as seen in Rise of the Killbots), ROBLOXians find themselves in a newly rebuilt, post-war ROBLOXia. 2 major battlefields, Crossroads and Chaos Canyon, were merged together during the reformation of ROBLOXia. During the events of the war, ROBLOXian scientists discovered ways to make ROBLOXians more durable and agile. Since fatalities reached the hundreds of thousands, these abilities were given to citizens after the war. Weapon manufacturers produced higher power versions of the age old brickbattle weapons to replace the damaged pistols and shotguns of the war. Then came the time to test these all out.

In Crossroads Evolved, you are a participant in a brickbattling tournament headed by ROBLOXian billionaires, ran for their entertainment. Using your increased strength and agility, fight with familiar but new weapons in 2 nostalgic connected arenas. The tournament isn't safe from other foes, however. You will sometimes face infected ROBLOXian zombies, and the remaining Delta troops of the Killbot army. Only the strongest survive.
